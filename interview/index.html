    <h1>1. What is box sizing ?</h1>
     <ul>
        <li>The box-sizing CSS property sets how the total width and height of an element is calculated.</li> <br>
        <li>The box-sizing property allows us to include the padding and border in an element's total width and height. If you set box-sizing: border-box; on an element, padding and border are included in the width and height: Both divs are the same size now! Hooray!</li>
     </ul>

            nt of time to wait from applying the animation to an element before beginning to perform the animation. The animation can start later, immediately from its beginning, or immediately and partway through the animation.</li> <br>
        <li>The transition-delay CSS property specifies the duration to wait before starting a property's transition effect when its value changes. </li> <br>
       </ul>
       <h3>3.Which property you will use to merge cells vertically in grid ?</h3>
       <ul>
        <li>CSS grid-column property.</li><br>
        <li>The grid property is a shorthand property for: grid-template-rows. grid-template-columns. grid-template-areas.</li> <br>
        <li>The grid CSS property is a shorthand property that sets all of the explicit and implicit grid properties in a single declaration. </li> <br>

       <h3>4.Which property you will use to merge cells horizontally in grid ?</h3>
       <ul>
        <li>There are two methods setting horizontally merging. The first is using CTHMerge which is similar to the vertically merging using CTVMerge and it does not explicitly need a table grid. The second is using grid span properties. </li><br>
        <li>To merge cells in Excel, select the cells you want to merge, click the Merge list arrow and select a merge option. </li><br>

       <h4>1.Display none :</h4>
       <ol>
        <li> display:none removes the element from the document. It does not take up any space. </li><br>
        <li>display:none means that the tag in question will not appear on the page at all (although you can still interact with it through the dom). There will be no space allocated for it between the other tags:</li><br>
        <li>Display:none hides the element from the page, and the space it would take up on the page can be used by other elements.</li><br>
       </ol>
       <h5>2.visibility hidden :</h5>
       <ol>
        <li>visibility:hidden hides the element, but it still takes up space in the layout.</li><br>
        <li> visibility:hidden hides the elements, but it continues to consume the space it normally would.</li><br>
       </ol>
